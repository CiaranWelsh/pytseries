`tslearn` is a Python package that provides machine learning tools for the analysis of time series.
This package builds on `scikit-learn`, `numpy` and `scipy` libraries.

If you would like to contribute to `tslearn`, please have a look at [our contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Dependencies

```
Cython
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn
```

If you plan to use the `shapelets` module, `keras` should also be installed.

# Installation

## Using conda

The easiest way to install `tslearn` is probably via `conda`:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tslearn
```

## Using PyPI

Using `pip` should also work fine:
```bash
pip install tslearn
```

## Using latest github-hosted version

If you want to get `tslearn`'s latest version, you can refer to the repository hosted at github:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rtavenar/tslearn.git
```

## Troubleshooting

It seems on some platforms `Cython` dependency does not install properly.
If you experiment such an issue, try installing it with the following command:

```bash 
pip install cython
```

or (depending on your preferred python package manager):
```bash
conda install -c anaconda cython
```

before you start installing `tslearn`.

# Documentation and API reference

The documentation, including a gallery of examples, is hosted at [readthedocs](http://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

# Already available

* A `generators` module provides Random Walks generators
* A `datasets` module provides access to the famous UCR/UEA datasets through the `UCR_UEA_datasets` class 
* A `preprocessing` module provides standard time series scalers
* A `metrics` module provides:
  * Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) (with Sakoe-Chiba band and Itakura parallelogram variants)
  * LB_Keogh
  * Global Alignment Kernel
  * Soft-DTW from Cuturi and Blondel
* A `neighbors` module includes nearest neighbor algorithms to be used with time series
* An `svm` module includes Support Vector Machine algorithms with:
  * Standard kernels offered in `sklearn` (with adequate array reshaping done for you)
  * Global Alignment Kernel
* A `clustering` module includes the following time series clustering algorithms:
  * Standard Euclidean k-means (with adequate array reshaping done for you)
    * Based on `tslearn.barycenters`
  * DBA k-means from Petitjean _et al._
    * Based on `tslearn.barycenters` that offers DBA facility that could be used for other applications than just 
    k-means
  * Global Alignment kernel k-means
  * KShape clustering from Paparizzos and Gravano
  * Soft-DTW k-means from Cuturi and Blondel
    * Based on `tslearn.barycenters` that offers Soft-DTW barycenter computation
  * It also provides a way to compute the silhouette coefficient for given clustering and metric
* A `shapelets` module includes an efficient implementation of the Learning Time-Series method from Grabocka _et al._
  * **Warning:** to use the `shapelets` module, an extra dependency is required: `keras`
* A `piecewise` module includes standard time series transformations, as well as the corresponding distances:
  * Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)
  * Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX)
  * 1d-Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (1d-SAX)

**If you want other ML methods for time series to be added to this TODO list, do not hesitate to open an issue!** See [our contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how to proceed.
